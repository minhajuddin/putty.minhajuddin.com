                <p>
                When you click the following button, we redirect immediately
                However, when the target location takes 10 seconds to load and it *seems* that this page is slow to redirect.
                </p>
                <button id='redirect'>Redirect</button>
                <script>
                        document.getElementById('redirect').addEventListener('click', function() {
                                window.location.href = 'https://httpbin.org/delay/10';
                        });
